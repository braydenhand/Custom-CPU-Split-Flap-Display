This is a Custom 5 Stage CPU I made in Verilog running at 100Mhz and code to run 6 split-flap display barrels in both an animation mode and a custom typing mode. 

To run this project, download the simulation file for vivado and import the sources. The CPU can be simulated and compiled using MIPS code -> assembly following the default
ISA (for the most part). I plan to release a full opensource guide for building this project in the future, so stay tuned!
